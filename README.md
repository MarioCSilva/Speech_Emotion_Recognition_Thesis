# Speech Emotion Recognition Thesis

This repository contains some of the work developed during my software engineering master's. Initially for a research grant, and later for my dissertation as well.

The area of this work is Speech Emotion Recognition (SER). If you intend to develop something in this area, I advise you to go through my [dissertation](https://github.com/MarioCSilva/Speech_Emotion_Recognition_Thesis/blob/main/Thesis_Mario_Silva/Dissertation.pdf) and some presentations present in the folder `Thesis_Mario_Silva`, to have an overview of what this repository contains, as the process of tackling SER problems, from start to finish, is present within this repository.

Also, from this thesis a set of [SER Tools](https://vader-proj.github.io/SER_Tools/) was developed, such as machine learning models and an audio pipeline to process audio, online or offline time, to be used for SER classifications.
